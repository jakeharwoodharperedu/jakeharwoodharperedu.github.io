      Topic 1: The History of the Internet
      In this activity I learned about the origins and development of the Internet. 
      It was fascinating to see how the internet flows through physical chords of light, 
      I never knew fiber optic cables were actual light instead of electricity, 
      but I guess that makes the word optic there make more sense. 
      The transition from it starting as a military project into becoming a global network 
      that connects billions of citizens makes sense considering all the other war originated 
      inventions that have been adapted by the general public.
      
      Although this aspect of knowledge doesn't seem directly applicable to something one will 
      actually be doing with internet technology and coding, this knowledge is still important 
      to have because it's important to grasp all functions of the technology
      we work with in order to truly have the feeling of understanding it
      so as to make it less intimidating.

      Topic 2: Manage folders and files
      This activity provided an overview of how to effectively manage folders and files in Windows. 
      I already knew most of what there was to know about file explorer stuff,  but it did teach me a few
      methods i didn't know about. 
      Like holding the Alt key on the keyboard then draging the file to the desktop creates a shortcut.
      And like how to select a group of files by clicking the first file then while holding Shift on the keyboard 
      click the last file, so that all of the files between the first and last ones will be selected.
      
      One can apply this knowledge in all aspects of using a computer.  Knowing how to properly organize and mangage
      and sort through and move files and folders is essential to do most anything on a computer.
