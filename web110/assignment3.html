        <h2>Wikiversity Email Activities</h2>
        <p>
          I completed all of the email assignments, I don't think I really learned all that much new stuff though because I already knew all about email.<br> 
          But I did learn about email spoofing which is something I didn't know about before.<br>

        <h2>Wikiversity Social Media Activities</h2>
        <p>
          I completed the Blog Basics activity, which taught about creating blogs and reading blogs.<br>
          I can use this skill to make blogs.<br>
          I set up an Instagram account, a facebook account, a Twitter account, a Snapchat account.  <br>
          The Twitter UI is pretty good, modern looking and on point and well organized, unfortunately there isn't much good on it.<br>
          The facebook UI is odd looking and unappealing, with a unintuitive and dated layout. <br>
          Instagram is the most modern, but in a way i think it might actually die out before twitter, since it's only usecase is for photo updates.<br>
          Snapchat is alright.<br>

        <h2>Wikiversity Communications Activities</h2>
        <p>
          I learned about VoIP and FTP, I've heard of them before but I didn't really know what they were. <br>
          I might be able to utilize VoIP in the future if there serves a need for it, but I don't know if that's that likely these days.  <br>
          But I think I definitely will be utilizing FTP in the future.<br>
