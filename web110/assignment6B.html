    <h1>Assignment 6B</h1>
    <p>
        I completed the activities;<br>
        1: Review Mozilla: What is accessibility, <br>
        2: Use the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate HTML for one or more web pages,<br>
        3: Use the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to evaluate web accessibility for one or more web pages, <br>
        4: Use the WebAIM: Contrast Checker to check color contrast for one or more web pages. <br>
        I learned the importance of web accessibility and how to  <br>
        improve it using various tools.  By adding proper alt tags for the visually impaired,<br>
        ensuring sufficient contrast for photosensitive or hard of seeing, <br>
        and providing transcripts for the deaf, <br>
        I can create more inclusive web experiences. <br>
        These skills will help me build websites that are accessible to all users, <br>
        including those with disabilities.<br>
