    <p>
        This lesson taught me the importance of web accessibility and how to evaluate and 
        improve it using various tools. By adding proper ALT tags, ensuring sufficient 
        contrast, and providing transcripts, I can create more inclusive web experiences. 
        These skills will help me build websites that are accessible to all users, 
        including those with disabilities.
