      Activity 1: Exploring Web Browsers<br>
      <br>
      For the first activity I explored different web browsers to understand their features, capabilities,<br>
      and differences.  I learned that web browsers are software applications used to access information<br>
      on the World Wide Web. Each browser has unique features; Google Chrome is known for<br>
      its commonality and extensive extensions, Firefox for its privacy and customization options,<br>
      Opera for its low resource usage for the pc's CPU and Memory,<br>
      and Safari for its standardization on Apple devices.<br>
      I also learned about customization abilities of web browsers, some things I didn't know before.  Like that<br>
      you can set any website as your browsers home page.<br>
      <br>
      Application: <br>
      In my current environment, I have all of these browsers and it's my conclusion that Firefox is the best.<br>
      Opera doesn't actually use less resources as it claims, and it sometimes crashes if its using too much memory.<br>
      A good thing about Opera is when you pc turns off and the browser closes, when you turn the pc on<br>
      it reopens all the Opera windows just how they were, which Google Chrome isn't able to do close to as reliably<br>
      or effectively.  Chrome isn't very customizable either, its much more of a vannilla common use browser with<br>
      no extra features, but it can be a bit too janky.  But Firefox is fully customizable and can do anything<br>
      the other browsers can do if set the settings to make it so, but it'll probably be able to do it better.<br>
      Firefox is also better for mobile because it allows you to use every kind of extension, whereas mobile Chrome<br>
      mobile can't install something like the uBlock extension.  But Chrome mobile does have a good feature<br>
      called tab islands, which is better than Firefox mobile's tabs that aren't segregated at all. but I think you<br>
      might be able to add the feature of tab islands to Firefox mobile.<br>
      So with what I learned I can apply new tips on customizing my browser.

      Activity 2: Understanding URLs and Domain Names<br>
      <br>
      The second activity involved learning about URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and domain names.<br>
      I discovered that a URL is an address used to access resources on the internet, and it<br>
      consists of the protocol (http/https),<br>
      domain name (wikiversity.org), and path to the specific resource (wiki/Internet_Fundamentals/Web_Browsers#Activities).<br>
      I also learned about the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates human-friendly domain names<br>
      into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.<br>
      <br>
      Application: <br>
      I think this knowledge is important for my future endeavors in web development.<br>
      Understanding how URLs and DNS work will may be a requirement to effectively structure website addresses<br>
      logically.  It could also aid in troubleshooting and optimizing websites for search engines.
