      Activity 1: Exploring Web Browsers
      
      For the first activity I explored different web browsers to understand their features, capabilities, 
      and differences.  I learned that web browsers are software applications used to access information 
      on the World Wide Web. Each browser has unique features; Google Chrome is known for 
      its commonality and extensive extensions, Firefox for its privacy and customization options, 
      Opera for its low resource usage for the pc's CPU and Memory, 
      and Safari for its standardization on Apple devices.
      I also learned about customization abilities of web browsers, some things I didn't know before.  Like that
      you can set any website as your browsers home page.
      
      Application: 
      In my current environment, I have all of these browsers and it's my conclusion that Firefox is the best. 
      Opera doesn't actually use less resources as it claims, and it sometimes crashes if its using too much memory.  
      A good thing about Opera is when you pc turns off and the browser closes, when you turn the pc on
      it reopens all the Opera windows just how they were, which Google Chrome isn't able to do close to as reliably 
      or effectively.  Chrome isn't very customizable either, its much more of a vannilla common use browser with
      no extra features, but it can be a bit too janky.  But Firefox is fully customizable and can do anything 
      the other browsers can do if set the settings to make it so, but it'll probably be able to do it better. 
      Firefox is also better for mobile because it allows you to use every kind of extension, whereas mobile Chrome
      mobile can't install something like the uBlock extension.  But Chrome mobile does have a good feature
      called tab islands, which is better than Firefox mobile's tabs that aren't segregated at all. but I think you
      might be able to add the feature of tab islands to Firefox mobile.
      So with what I learned I can apply new tips on customizing my browser.

      Activity 2: Understanding URLs and Domain Names
      
      The second activity involved learning about URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and domain names. 
      I discovered that a URL is an address used to access resources on the internet, and it 
      consists of the protocol (http/https), 
      domain name (wikiversity.org), and path to the specific resource (wiki/Internet_Fundamentals/Web_Browsers#Activities). 
      I also learned about the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates human-friendly domain names 
      into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.
      
      Application: 
      I think this knowledge is important for my future endeavors in web development. 
      Understanding how URLs and DNS work will may be a requirement to effectively structure website addresses 
      logically.  It could also aid in troubleshooting and optimizing websites for search engines.
