    <h1>Assignment 5a</h1>
    <p>
      During this lesson, I learned how to make HTML lists, <br>
      how to host a static site for free on bitbucket alongside github,  <br>
      and what various tags mean and how to use them.  <br>
      Like image tags, header tags, meta tags, <br>
      anchor link tag and href attribute capabilities.<br>
      I completed activities 1, 2, and 4 on https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Internet_Fundamentals/HTML.
