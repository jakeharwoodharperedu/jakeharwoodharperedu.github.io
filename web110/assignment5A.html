    <h1>Assignment 5a</h1>
    <p>
      During this lesson, I learned how to make HTML lists, how to host a static site for free on bitbucket 
      alongside github,  and what various tags mean and how to use them.  Like image tags, header tags, meta tags, 
      anchor link tag and href attribute capabilities.
      I completed activities 1, 2, and 4 on https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Internet_Fundamentals/HTML
