Completing TutorialsPoint<br>
      I completed the tutorials from GCFLearnFree and TutorialsPoint that focused on internet safety and security. <br>
      The GCFLearnFree tutorial emphasized best practices for maintaining internet safety, <br>
      such as creating strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, and ensuring software updates. <br>
      The TutorialsPoint internet security tutorial covered various security threats, including malware, phishing, <br>
      and other cyber attacks, and talked about measures to protect personal information online. <br>
      These tutorials provided a thorough understanding of the types of threats present on the internet.<br>

Testing Firewall Effectiveness<br>
      The second activity I did focused on testing firewall effectiveness using Gibson Research's ShieldsUP!.<br>
      This involved scanning my system for open ports and vulnerabilities to assess the firewall's. <br>
      ShieldsUP scanned for potential security vulnerabilities and gathered all that it could from my IP address. <br> 
      I tried it's scan while using a VPN, then again with it off. <br>
      This hands-on test allowed me to see firsthand how vulnerabilities could be identified and addressed.<br>
