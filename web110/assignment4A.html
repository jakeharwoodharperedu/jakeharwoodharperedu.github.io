Completing TutorialsPoint<br>
      In the Internet Fundamentals/Networking lesson, my first activity was completing the <br>
      tutorials from TutorialsPoint. <br>
      These tutorials covered Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, <br>
      and the Domain Name System (DNS). The Internet Reference Models tutorial provided a detailed explanation <br>
      of the OSI model, explaining the seven layers and their functions. <br>
      The Internet Protocols tutorial focused on the various protocols that facilitate communication <br>
      over the internet, such as TCP/IP, UDP, and HTTP. <br>
      The DNS tutorial explained how domain names are translated into IP addresses, <br>
      making it possible for users to access websites using human-readable names. <br>

Verifying Internet Connectivity<br>
      The second activity I did involved verifying internet connectivity.<br>
      This involved using ipconfig on the command prompt, and using a trace route website.<br>
      I used the ping command to test local and remote connectivity by pinging my local IP address, <br>
      the default gateway, and an internet host 8.8.8.8. <br>
      These activities provided practical skills in diagnosing and confirming network connectivity issues.<br>
