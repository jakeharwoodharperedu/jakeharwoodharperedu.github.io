    <h1><br>Final Project - Applied Internet Activities</h1>
    <p>This page outlines the objectives, scope, and timeline for the final project.</p>
    <h2><br>Project Objectives and Scope</h2>
    <p> The purpose of the final project is to create a comprehensive 10 minute multimedia presentation demonstrating <br>
        mastery of course concepts. The presentation must include both visual and audio aspects and be posted on YouTube.<br> 
        The purpose of the project is to replicate the potential future work assignment of being a project manager for a project,<br>
        or even just working on a project.<br></p>
    <h2><br>Final Project Topic</h2>
    <p>My selected topic for the final project is designing a github website.</p>
    <h2><br>Gantt Chart</h2>

    <h2><br>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>While completing these activities, I learned the importance of planning and time management in executing a <br>
        project. Creating the Gantt chart helped me visualize the timeline and plan sufficient time for each task,<br> 
        ensuring an organized project.<br>  
        This knowledge is applicable to my current and future projects, which may require the need for structured planning<br> 
        and progress tracking.<br></p>
    <h2><br>Final Project Idea</h2>
        <p>My final project will focus on how to set up a github website. The presentation will cover the process <br>
            of creating a github repository, setting up github pages, and making a basic website using html, <br>
            css, and js. It's going to include a step by step guide on setting up a github website starting from square one,<br>
            like if the only prerequisite is a computer and google.</p>
