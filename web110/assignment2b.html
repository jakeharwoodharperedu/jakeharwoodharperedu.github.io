      Activity 1: Use the Internet Archive<br>
      <br> 
      I explored the Internet Archive. I learned that it not only stores web pages but also has a large collection<br>
      of free books, movies, and software.  I browsed through various website's old crawled web pages using the calander<br> 
      feature.  This archive helps to preserve the digital history of the internet, and can be useful for research and<br> 
      understanding the development and changes of a website over time.<br>
      <br>
      Application: <br>
      I can apply the knowledge gained from the Internet Archive to research projects<br> 
      for historical analysis.  For example if I'm trying to find some long lost image for fun,<br>
      the Wayback Machine can hold a better chance at helping find it.<br>  
      Also in a professional setting it could maybe help in auditing, to find changes to a company's<br> 
      website or in recovering information from past versions of web pages that are no longer available.<br>

      Activity 2: Practice with Google Search Operators<br>
      <br>
      Google Search Operators seem to be an incredibly useful and important tool. <br>
      Through practicing with these operators, I learned how to use specific commands like "site:", "filetype:", "intitle:",<br> 
      and "inurl:" to narrow down search results.  For example, using "site:wikipedia.org" will make it so the Google <br>
      search only displays web pages within Wikipedia, and "filetype:pdf" filters the search results to only show <br>
      PDF document files, which can signifcantly <br>
      reduce the time spent sifting through irrelevant results.<br>
      <br>
      Application: <br>
      Youtube recently drastically changed their search feature to be much worse, so I could use<br> 
      Google searches with the use of search operators like "site:youtube.com" to effectively do a<br> 
      Youtube search, but on Google.<br>
      In academic research usage of these search operators can help locate specific information like<br> 
      scholarly articles or case studies quickly.<br>
      Knowing how to effectively use these search operators can improve my overall ability and efficiency <br>
      in navigating the vast amount there is online.  <br>
